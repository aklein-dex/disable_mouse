# disable_mouse

Disable mouse highlight on task swithing (Xubuntu 16.04).

When you press alt+tab to switch windows, if your mouse is over a window then the background will be blue and you will think it has the focus but it is not necessarly true.
This blue higlthing with the mouse is just confusing, so with this project I was able to disable it.

## Installation

Copy both files .gtkrc-2.0 and panel-button-hover.png in your home folder.

Log off and log in.

No more frustration!
